/*A Python program that takes a song, in this case the song is Eastside by Benny Blanco; however, any song should work and counts the quantity of words in said song. Program uses basic counters and call functions to accomplish this. This is one of the first Python programs I have ever wrote so it is extremely rudimentary, but fun to experiement with large bodies of text.*/
